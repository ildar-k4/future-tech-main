FutureTech AI News Website

Overview

This is the source code for the FutureTech AI News website, a platform dedicated to exploring advancements in artificial intelligence and future technologies. The site includes sections for news, blogs, podcasts, resources, and testimonials, providing users with comprehensive insights into AI and related fields.

Getting Started

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

Locate the Entry Point:
Find the index.html file in the project root directory. This is the main entry point for the website.

Run the Website:
Install the Live Server extension in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server" to launch the website in your default browser.
Alternatively, you can use any local server solution (e.g., npm install -g live-server and run live-server in the project directory).

Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file for the homepage.
styles/main.css: The CSS stylesheet for styling the website.
scripts/main.js: The JavaScript file (loaded as a module) for interactive functionality.
images/: Directory containing images, icons, and other assets used in the website.
Other HTML files: Additional pages like news.html, podcasts.html, resources.html, and contacts.html are linked from the navigation menu.

Dependencies
The website uses no external libraries; it relies on vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Ensure all linked assets (e.g., images, CSS, and JS files) are in their respective directories as referenced in index.html.

Notes
The website is designed to be responsive, with a mobile-friendly navigation menu (burger menu) for smaller screens.
Ensure you have a stable internet connection if testing links to external resources (e.g., social media or newsletter subscriptions).
For development, you may need to adjust file paths if moving or restructuring the project.
